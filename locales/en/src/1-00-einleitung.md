# Introduction {#einleitung}

This document contains the specification of the OParl interface standard for parliamentary information systems ^ [in Germany the term "Ratsinformationssystem" is established at the municipal level. However, OParl is not limited to municipal councils and therefore the term "parliamentary information system" is being used. It serves as the basis for the implementation of OParl compliant server and client applications.
